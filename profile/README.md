This Github organization puts together data and methods required to compute the likelihood for several cosmological experiments.

Actually, the likelihood included are:

- Planck temperature and polarization anisotropies, with [`PlanckLite.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/PlanckLite.jl)
- ACT temperature and polarization anisotropies, with [`ACTPolLite.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/ACTPolLite.jl)
- Power Spectrum measurements from the Blinded Challenge dataset, with [`BlindedChallenge.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/BlindedChallenge.jl)

## Publications

The codes previously listed are used in the following publications:
- Bonici, Bianchini, and Ruiz-Zapatero, _Capse.jl: efficient and auto-differentiable CMB power spectra emulation_ [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2307.14339-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14339)
