This Github organization puts together data and methods required to compute the likelihood for several cosmological experiments.

Actually, the likelihood included are:

- Planck temperature and polarization anisotropies, with [`PlanckLite.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/PlanckLite.jl)
- ACT temperature and polarization anisotropies, with [`ACTPolLite.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/ACTPolLite.jl)
- SPT temperature and polarization anisotropies, with [`SPTLikelihoods.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/SPTLikelihoods.jl)
- Power Spectrum measurements from the Blinded Challenge dataset, with [`BlindedChallenge.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/BlindedChallenge.jl)
- BOSS full shape data, with [`BOSSLikelihoods.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/BOSSLikelihoods.jl)
- Supernova data, with [`SNIaLikelihoods.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCosmologicalLikelihoods/SNIaLikelihoods.jl)
